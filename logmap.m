%% Logistic Map for a given rate of growth

%The population of a given environment, belonging to [0, 1], grows at a 
%given rate r for each period of time given the constraint 1 minus the 
%previous period population.
%We get recurrent patterns by changing the value of r between 0 and 4.
%The following code displays the formation of such patterns.

N=500;%n째 of periods
seq=zeros(N,1);%vector of the population level at each period
n=rand();%starting population, random
% n=0.5;%uncomment to enter a given starting population
seq(1,1)=n;
r= 3.5;%rate of growth

scatter(1,seq(1,1), '.', 'b');
drawnow
hold on
grid on

for i=2:N
    seq(i,1)=seq(i-1,1)*(1-seq(i-1))*r;
    scatter(i,seq(i,1), '.', 'b');
    drawnow%comment to obtain just the final result
    hold on

%% Logistic map for each level of rate of growth

%The following code displays the value(s) at which the logistic function
%converges at each level of rate of growth. The index S determines,
%starting from the last period, how many observations will be plotted, such
%that, the higher S, the more tight the representation will be. However, it
%is better to keep S at least 100 units less than N, in order to avoid the
%representation of the first sequences, which will alter the shape of the
%map.
